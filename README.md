## Language AI Domain  

### Language-Related AI Tasks  
- **Text-related Tasks**: Use text as input and produce varied outputs.  
- **Generative AI Tasks**: Output text is generated by a model.  
- **Mechanism**: Trained on large language models (LLMs).  

### Text as Data  
- **Sequential Nature**: Text consists of sentences.  
- **Tokenization**: Converting words into numbers.  
- **Embedding**: Representing similarity of words/sentences.  

### Deep Learning Architectures  
- **RNNs**: Sequential, hidden states.  
- **LSTM**: Retain context.  
- **Transformers**: Parallel, self-attention.  

**80/20 Insight**: Mastering **Transformers (BERT, GPT)** gives you 80% leverage in NLP tasks.

## Audio & Speech AI Domain  

### Types of Audio Tasks  
- **Speech Recognition**  
- **Speaker Identification**  
- **Emotion Detection**  

### Audio as Data  
- **Waveforms**  
- **Spectrograms**  

### Deep Learning Architectures  
- **CNNs for Spectrograms**  
- **RNNs for Sequential Audio**  
- **Transformers for Speech**  

**80/20 Insight**: Focus on **Spectrograms + CNN/Transformers**—they dominate modern speech recognition systems like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant.

## Vision AI Domain  

### Vision Tasks  
- **Image Classification**  
- **Object Detection**  
- **Segmentation**  
- **Image Generation**  

### Images as Data  
- **Pixels**: RGB values.  
- **Grids**: Image as a 2D matrix.  

### Deep Learning Architectures  
- **CNNs**: Convolution for features.  
- **Transformers**: Attention for image patches.  

**80/20 Insight**: **CNNs** handle most vision problems, while **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** are becoming the next big standard.

## Other AI Tasks  

### Anomaly Detection  
Detecting unusual behavior in data.  
- Used in fraud detection, network security, and healthcare.  

### Recommendation Systems  
Suggesting items/content to users.  
- Used by Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify.  

### Forecasting  
Predicting future values based on historical data.  
- Used in stock markets, weather prediction, and supply chain.  

**80/20 Insight**: Most business use-cases fall into **Recommendations + Forecasting + Anomaly Detection**.  

---

## Summary  
AI domains cover **Language, Audio & Speech, and Vision**, with additional tasks like **Anomaly Detection, Recommendations, and Forecasting.**  

Deep learning models—**RNNs, LSTMs, CNNs, and Transformers**—are the backbone for these tasks.  

**80/20 Key Takeaway**:  
- Learn **Transformers (LLMs + Vision)**  
- Understand **CNNs for vision**  
- Use **Spectrograms + CNNs for speech**  

That’s the 20% knowledge covering 80% of practical AI applications 🚀
